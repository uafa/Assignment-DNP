First of all, you can\u2019t just jump straight into it \u2013 you\u2019ve got build up to it. Begin with a story of the repentant millionaire playboy who builds an iron suit with a nuclear heart from a box of scraps in a cave. Toss in a super soldier thawed from ice after 70 years. How about a magic hammer man from space, or the turncoat Russian spy who loses her accent real quick? It\u2019s a good start \u2013 just add a few dozen more characters, mix and match them across multiple serialized movies, and as the physics-defying superheroics pile up, all of a sudden, putting all your faith in a trigger happy trash panda makes plenty of sense in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nNot a bad world to build up for Marvel Studios, which originally had to put up the rights to Captain America, the Avengers, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and more as collateral just to get the funding to make 2008\u2019s Iron Man. Clearly, the movie bet of the century paid off, as an empire of 25 films (and counting) has flourished under Marvel Studios\u2019 Kevin Feige. The MCU has allowed generations of comic book fans to ascend to the highest throne in pop culture, while allowing millions more who have never visually connected comic page panels together to become versed in Wakandan politics as well as where to find the bathroom at the Sanctum Sanctorum. Iron Man, Guardian of the Galaxy, Captain America: The Winter Soldier are classics of the genre now, while Thor: Ragnarok, Captain Marvel, and Black Panther, and now Shang-Chi demonstrate superhero movies remain capable of reinvention for new relevancy.","PostId":3,"TimeStamp":"2022-10-23T15:45:49.6238845+02:00"},{"User":{"Username":"uafa","Password":"helloworld123","Email":"uafa@abv.bg"},"Title":"Just a post","Body":"Hello this is a post","PostId":4,"TimeStamp":"2022-11-08T13:19:38.1103754+01:00"},{"User":{"Username":"uafa","Password":"helloworld123","Email":"uafa@abv.bg"},"Title":"What to watch on Netflix today?","Body":"Netflix has something for everyone, but there are also plenty of duds.
